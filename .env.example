# ===================================================================
# NOTES:
# ===================================================================
# 
# 1. MINIMAL SETUP:
#    At minimum, set ONE of these API keys to start:
#    - GOOGLE_API_KEY (easiest, free tier available)
#    - OPENAI_API_KEY
#    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
#    - USE_LOCAL_LLM=true (requires Ollama installed)
#
# 2. FOR MOBILE TESTING:
#    - Install Appium: npm install -g appium
#    - Start Appium: appium (in separate terminal)
#    - For cloud: set LT_USERNAME and LT_ACCESS_KEY
#
# 3. FOR WEB TESTING:
#    - Install Playwright: playwright install chromium --with-deps
#    - Set GOOGLE_API_KEY (or other LLM provider)
#
# 4. SECURITY:
#    - Never commit .env file to version control
#    - Use .gitignore to exclude .env
#    - Use different keys for dev/staging/production
#    - Rotate keys regularly
#
# 5. VALIDATION:
#    Run: python config_manager.py
#    This will validate your configuration and show any issues
